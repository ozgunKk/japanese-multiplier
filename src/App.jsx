*   Title: Visual Japanese Multiplier
*
*   Description: A simple calculator that multiplies numbers as we normally do, 
* but with a visual twist. It adds a visual representation of the multiplication
* process, inspired by the Japanese multiplication method, which mostly used in
* elementary schools. The visual representation is a fun way to learn the
* multiplication process.
*
*  The calculator also has some easter eggs . Try to find them!
*
*  Go to README.md for more information.

# Japanese Multiplication
 A simple calculator that multiplies numbers as we normally do, 
but with a visual twist. It adds a visual representation of the multiplication
process, inspired by the Japanese multiplication method, which mostly used in
elementary schools. The visual representation is a fun way to learn the
multiplication process.

 The calculator also has some easter eggs . Try to find them! In case you want see all the easter egg scenarios, all written at the end of the page.

## Acknowledgments

 The user shall know that, while I developed this app, I took into account natural numbers less than 100. The reason is that the method is not useful with large numbers. Also, the main idea behind this app is to teach a method for multiplication to children, via an easy-to-use app with an understandable UI. For that reason, I wanted to skip the logic of implementing the visualizing of numbers with three digits.

 Another thing the consider; even though I have experience with developing with React, I didn't have any prior experience with creating a desktop application from it. So I created a desktop app using Electron, but Ä± can't say that I'm so happy with the window that appears at the moment.
